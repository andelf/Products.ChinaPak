Introduction
============

A Chinese Simplified pak for plone.

Tested only on plone 4.

Contain all .po files from ploe.app.locales 4.0.0, fully translated.

Also a chinese id normalizer. :)

covert all chinese characters to **-** splitted pinyin string.

like:

 - u"你好" => "ni-hao"
 - u"你好 Python" => "ni-hao-python"

Why
